# Contributing

If you're reading this, then you might be interested in contributing to the Qadenz project. That's awesome.

If you have an idea or a suggestion for something new to add to Qadenz, or have found a problem with one of the
components, I definitely want to hear from you.

### Create an Issue

The absolute best way to start contributing is to [create an issue](https://github.com/qadenz/qadenz/issues).

Please include as much detail regarding the feature, change, or fix, that you're proposing. In the case of a defect,
please add the usual information that we as testers are all familiar with (description, reproduction, actual/expected
results, etc.). For new features or changes, please be as specific as possible about what capability you're seeking to
have added or altered. Any additional design considerations regardless of the nature of your request would also be
helpful.

I will respond to all issues to address concerns, finalize any requirements, or clarify details.

### No Unsolicited Pull Requests

I'd like for all changes to the code to begin as Issues. This way, considerations to the impact of the changes can be
made (as much as possible) before development begins. To that end, I will ask that Pull Requests only be submitted by
those individuals to whom the related Issue has been assigned for development.

This will allow us ample opportunity to ensure we can iron out the details, discuss any design concerns, code style, and
other points of interest. To use a carpentry analogy, this is all in an effort to "measure twice and cut once".

### Going Forward

As the project takes root, I am sure this process will change and evolve to suit new needs. In the meantime, I feel this
is the best place to start.
